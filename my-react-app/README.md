To get started, clone this repository onto your local machine. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

## Key Concepts
The mini web app covers the following key concepts in React:

## Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of code that can be composed to create more complex UIs. In this app, you will create several components, including Post, and Comment.

## Props
Props are used to pass data between components. They are essentially the inputs to a component. In this app, you will use props to pass data from the App component to the child components.

## State
State is used to manage data that can change over time. In this app, you will use state to manage the list of posts and comments. When a user adds a new post or comment, the app will update its state accordingly.

## Events
Events are used to handle user interactions, such as clicks or form submissions. In this app, you will use events to handle the submission of new posts and comments.

## Data Fetching
Data fetching is a common task in web applications. In this app, you will fetch data from a fake API using the axios library. You will then use this data to populate the list of posts and comments.
